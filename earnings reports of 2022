First Quarter 2022 Unaudited Financial Results
Total revenues were RMB23,793.7 million (US$3,753.4 million), an increase of 7% from RMB22,167.1 million in the same quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues from online marketing services and transaction services, offset by the decrease of revenues from merchandise sales.
⚫ Revenues from online marketing services and others were RMB18,158.4 million (US$2,864.4 million), an increase of 29% from RMB14,111.5 million in the same quarter of 2021.
⚫ Revenues from transaction services were RMB5,591.4 million (US$882.0 million), an increase of 91% from RMB2,931.5 million in the same quarter of 2021.
⚫ Revenues from merchandise sales were RMB43.9 million (US$6.9 million), a decrease of 99% from RMB5,124.1 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Total costs of revenues were RMB7,159.6 million (US$1,129.4 million), a decrease of 33% from RMB10,746.1 million in the same quarter of 2021. The decrease mainly came from the reduction of merchandise sales partially offset by increased fulfillment fees.
2

Total operating expenses were RMB14,479.7 million (US$2,284.1 million), compared with RMB15,568.0 million in the same quarter of 2021.
⚫ Sales and marketing expenses were RMB11,219.1 million (US$1,769.8 million), decreased by 14% from RMB12,997.4 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to controlled spending in promotion and advertising activities.
⚫ General and administrative expenses were RMB592.1 million (US$93.4 million), an increase of 68% from RMB351.9 million in the same quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in staff related costs.
⚫ Research and development expenses were RMB2,668.5 million (US$420.9 million), an increase of 20% from RMB2,218.7 million in the same quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount and the recruitment of more experienced R&D personnel.
Operating profit was RMB2,154.4 million (US$339.8 million), compared with operating loss of RMB4,147.0 million in the same quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP operating profit was RMB3,677.2 million (US$580.1 million), compared with non-GAAP operating loss of RMB3,174.1 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB2,599.5 million (US$410.1 million), compared with net loss of RMB2,905.4 million in the same quarter of 2021. Non- GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB4,200.4 million (US$662.6 million), compared with non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB1,890.3 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Basic earnings per ADS was RMB2.06 (US$0.33) and diluted earnings per ADS was RMB1.84 (US$0.29), compared with basic and diluted net loss per ADS of RMB2.33 in the same quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB2.95 (US$0.47), compared with non-GAAP diluted net loss per ADS of RMB1.52 in the same quarter of 2021.
Net cash used in operating activities was RMB9,068.1 million (US$1,430.5 million), compared with RMB3,724.5 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to seasonality changes in working capitals offset by controlled cost and operating expenses spending.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were RMB95.2 billion (US$15.0 billion) as of March 31, 2022, compared with RMB92.9 billion as of December 31, 2021.

The Company will host a conference call to discuss the earnings at 7:30 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, May 27, 2022 (7:30 PM Beijing/Hong Kong Time on Friday, May 27, 2022).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non- GAAP operating profit or loss and non-GAAP net income or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude share-based compensation expenses, fair value change of long-term investments, and interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value and gain or loss on extinguishment.
The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, fair value change of long-term investments, and interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value and gain or loss on extinguishment, which is a non-cash charge. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures could provide further information about the Company’s results of operations, and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects.
The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect the Company’s operations and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The Company encourages you to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to The Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measures” set forth at the end of this press release.

Total revenues were RMB31,439.6 million (US$4,693.8 million), an increase of 36% from RMB23,046.2 million in the same quarter of 2021.

⚫ Revenues from online marketing services and others were RMB25,172.7 million (US$3,758.2 million), an increase of 39% from RMB18,080.4 million in the same quarter of 2021.
⚫ Revenues from transaction services were RMB6,216.2 million (US$928.1 million), an increase of 107% from RMB3,007.6 million in the same quarter of 2021.
⚫ Revenues from merchandise sales were RMB50.7 million (US$7.6 million), a decrease of 97% from RMB1,958.2 million in the same quarter of 2021.

Total operating expenses were RMB14,780.5 million (US$2,206.7 million), compared with RMB13,150.9 million in the same quarter of 2021.
⚫ Sales and marketing expenses were RMB11,343.4 million (US$1,693.5 million), an increase of 9% from RMB10,387.9 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to increased spending in promotion and advertising activities.
⚫ General and administrative expenses were RMB825.7 million (US$123.3 million), an increase of 90% from RMB434.2 million in the same quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in staff related costs.
⚫ Research and development expenses were RMB2,611.4 million (US$389.9 million), an increase of 12% from RMB2,328.8 million in the same quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount and the recruitment of more experienced R&D personnel.
Operating profit in the quarter was RMB8,697.2 million (US$1,298.5 million), an increase of 335% from RMB1,997.5 million in the same quarter of 2021.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB7.54 (US$1.13), compared with RMB2.85 in the same quarter of 2021.
Net cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB19,373.9 million (US$2,892.4 million), compared with RMB7,371.2 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to the increase in net income and the changes in working capitals.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were RMB119.4 billion (US$17.8 billion) as of June 30, 2022, compared with RMB92.9 billion as of December 31, 2021.

The Company will host a conference call to discuss the earnings at 7:30 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, August 29, 2022 (7:30 PM Beijing/Hong Kong Time on Monday, August 29, 2022).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non- GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude share-based compensation expenses, fair value change of long-term investments, and interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value and gain or loss on extinguishment.
The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, fair value change of long-term investments, and interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value and gain or loss on extinguishment, which are non-cash charges. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures could provide further information about the Company’s results of operations, and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects.
The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect the Company’s operations and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The Company encourages you to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to The Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measures” set forth at the end of this press release.

Third Quarter 2022 Unaudited Financial Results
Total revenues were RMB35,504.3 million (US$4,991.1 million), an increase of 65% from RMB21,505.8 million in the same quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues from online marketing services and transaction services, offset by the decrease of revenues from merchandise sales.
Revenues from online marketing services and others were RMB28,425.6 million (US$3,996.0 million), an increase of 58% from RMB17,946.5 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Revenues from transaction services were RMB7,022.3 million (US$987.2 million), an increase of 102% from RMB3,477.1 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Revenues from merchandise sales were RMB56.4 million (US$7.9 million), a decrease of 31% from RMB82.1 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Total costs of revenues were RMB7,414.1 million (US$1,042.3 million), an increase of 13% from RMB6,558.6 million in the same quarter of 2021. The increase mainly came from increased fulfillment fees and payment processing fees.
Total operating expenses were RMB17,653.6 million (US$2,481.7 million), an increase of 38% from RMB12,807.8 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Sales and marketing expenses were RMB14,048.8 million (US$1,975.0 million), an increase of 40% from RMB10,050.6 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to increased spending in promotion and advertising activities.
General and administrative expenses were RMB906.6 million (US$127.4 million), an increase of 171% from RMB334.8 million in the same quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in staff related costs.
Research and development expenses were RMB2,698.2 million (US$379.3 million), an increase of 11% from RMB2,422.4 million in the same quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount and the recruitment of more experienced R&D personnel.

Operating profit in the quarter was RMB10,436.6 million (US$1,467.2 million), an increase of 388% from RMB2,139.3 million in the same quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP operating profit in the quarter was RMB12,301.5 million (US$1,729.3 million), an increase of 277% from RMB3,260.7 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in the quarter was RMB10,588.6 million (US$1,488.5 million), an increase of 546% from RMB1,640.0 million in the same quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in the quarter was RMB12,447.2 million (US$1,749.8 million), an increase of 295% from RMB3,150.2 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Basic earnings per ADS was RMB8.38 (US$1.18) and diluted earnings per ADS was RMB7.34 (US$1.03), compared with basic earnings per ADS of RMB1.31 and diluted earnings per ADS of RMB1.15 in the same quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB8.62 (US$1.21), compared with RMB2.18 in the same quarter of 2021.
Net cash flow provided by operating activities was RMB11,651.8 million (US$1,638.0 million), compared with RMB8,736.6 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to the increase in net income and the changes in working capitals.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were RMB137.8 billion (US$19.4 billion) as of September 30, 2022, compared with RMB92.9 billion as of December 31, 2021.
Conference Call
The Company will host a conference call to discuss the earnings at 7:30 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, November 28, 2022 (8:30 PM Beijing/Hong Kong Time on Monday, November 28, 2022).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude share-based compensation expenses, fair value change of long-term investments, and interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value and gain or loss on extinguishment.
The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, fair value change of long-term investments, and interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value and gain or loss on extinguishment, which are non-cash charges. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures could provide further information about the Company’s results of operations, and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects.
The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect the Company’s operations and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The Company encourages you to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to The Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measures” set forth at the end of this press release.

Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results
Total revenues were RMB39,820.0 million (US$5,773.4 million), an increase of 46% from RMB27,230.9 million in the same quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues from online marketing services and transaction services, partially offset by the decrease of revenues from merchandise sales.
Revenues from online marketing services and others were RMB30,965.2 million (US$4,489.5 million), an increase of 38% from RMB22,425.0 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Revenues from transaction services were RMB8,796.6 million (US$1,275.4 million), an increase of 86% from RMB4,724.2 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Revenues from merchandise sales were RMB58.2 million (US$8.4 million), a decrease of 29% from RMB81.7 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Total costs of revenues were RMB8,926.7 million (US$1,294.3 million), an increase of 37% from RMB6,515.5 million in the same quarter of 2021. The increase mainly came from the increased server cost due to a one-off rebate in the fourth quarter of 2021 and increased fulfilment fees.
Total operating expenses were RMB21,779.6 million (US$3,157.7 million), compared with RMB13,808.4 million in the same quarter of 2021.
Sales and marketing expenses were RMB17,732.4 million (US$2,571.0 million), an increase of 56% from RMB11,365.8
million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to the increased spending in promotion and advertising activities.
General and administrative expenses were RMB1,640.5 million (US$237.9 million), an increase of 291% from RMB420.0 million in the same quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in staff related costs.
Research and development expenses were RMB2,406.7 million (US$348.9 million), an increase of 19% from RMB2,022.6 million in the same quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount and the recruitment of more experienced R&D personnel and server cost.
Operating profit in the quarter was RMB9,113.7 million (US$1,321.4 million), an increase of 32% from RMB6,907.0 million in the same quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP operating profit in the quarter was RMB11,600.1 million (US$1,681.9 million), an increase of 38% from RMB8,399.7 million in the

same quarter of 2021.

Basic earnings per ADS was RMB7.42 (US$1.08) and the diluted earnings per ADS was RMB6.52 (US$0.95), compared with basic earnings per ADS of RMB5.26 and diluted earnings per ADS of RMB4.66 in the same quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB8.34 (US$1.21), compared with RMB5.88 in the same quarter of 2021.
Net cash generated from operating activities was RMB26,550.3 million (US$3,849.4 million), compared with RMB16,399.8 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to the increase in net income and the changes in working capitals.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude
 
share-based compensation expenses, fair value change of certain investments, and interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value and gain or loss on extinguishment.
The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, fair value change of certain investments, and interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value and gain or loss on extinguishment, which are non-cash charges. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures could provide further information about the Company’s results of operations, and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects.
The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect the Company’s operations and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The Company encourages you to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to The Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measures” set forth at the end of this press release.
